This code was written as part of a course by Dr Anil Variyar as a pytorch quick start and tutorial. The jupyter notebook sets up and trains the neural network to play TicTacToe. 

The folder contains a streamlit app that the neural network can be plugged into to actually see if the MLP can play TTT with simple Adam based training.
